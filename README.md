# SZCodeBaseX
This is SZCodeBaseX version 1.3.3 as published by Sasa Zeman on torry.net (http://torry.net/authorsmore.php?id=5726).
I added changes to allow compatibility with FPC and Unicode Delphi as suggested on the DelphiOTP repository (https://github.com/wendelb/DelphiOTP).

# Description
Universal Encode/Decode algorithms for Base16, Base32 and Base64: 

* Standard Base16, Base32 and Base64 encoding/decoding functions;

* Full MIME suppport;
* Supported work with Memory, Streams, Strings and Files;
